## Solutions Log üìö

Here is a list of the problems I have solved so far. As I solve more, I will add them to this table.

| Problem Name | Topic | Link to Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First Code Example | Arrays | [firstcode.cpp](./solutions/firstcode.cpp) |
| Function 1 Example | Functions | [function1.cpp](./solutions/function1.cpp) |
| *Add your next solution here* | *e.g., Strings* | *Link to the .cpp file* |

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

To run any of the C++ solutions on your local machine, you'll need a C++ compiler like g++.

### How to Compile and Run a File

1.  **Navigate to the `solutions` folder** in your terminal.
2.  **Compile the file** using `g++`. For example, to compile `firstcode.cpp`:
    ```bash
    g++ firstcode.cpp -o firstcode
    ```
3.  **Run the executable** that was just created:
    ```bash
    ./firstcode
    ```
